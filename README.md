This is an experiment comparing 3 frameworks for 2D games development.
The experiment tries to create a game launcher like a menu in PS3.

The frameworks:

1. [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) and [Love2d](https://love2d.org/)
2. [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org)
3. [Go](https://golang.org/) and [Engo](https://engo.io/)

For each a folder is prepare and a Makefile that allows running a demo.
To run demo go into the folder e.g. love and invoke:

```bash
$ make play
```
